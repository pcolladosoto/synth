# A math-oriented WebAudio API-based two-tone synth
Just like the name implies, this repository contains the implementation
of a two-sine synth. In order to leverage it on a math class, we have
included visualisations of both the time and frequency domains so that
one can really "see" what's going on behind the scenes.

In order to work, this synth leverages the help of both [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org)
as well as the [dsp.js](https://github.com/corbanbrook/dsp.js/) library. We of course
rely on the standard [WebAudio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)
together with [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com) for the frontend.

The tool's layout is based on the [jumbotron example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/jumbotron/)
offered by the Bootstrap team.

On top of the above, we have queried tons of sites in our effort to get things working. These
are included on the `tabs` file.
